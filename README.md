## Problem Statement
How might we help college students access personalized career advice through building and maintaing relationships with industry professionals?


## Summary
It is difficult for college students to find valuable career guidance. In surveys with college students, over 50% of respondents said they use social media (e.g., YouTube and TikTok) as their primary source for career advice. However, the advice presented on these platforms is not personalized to the user and may not be applicable and helpful to them. 

We interviewed college students to understand their previous experiences finding mentors. Our interviewees reported having limited avenues of connecting with industry professionals: through a school mentorship program, an internship, or LinkedIn. All interviewees said they felt nervous when reaching out to an industry professional for the first time and uncertain about how to maintain a relationship with an industry professional.

Our solution to these pain points is UpConnect, a dedicated platform for college students to meet industry professionals in their career fields. Upconnect allows students to search for and schedule meetings with mentors who can answer their questions and offer personalized career guidance. UpConnect also contains articles that give students advice on how to communicate and maintain a relationship with their mentor.
